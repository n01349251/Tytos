                <img data-aos="fade-left" src="./images/andaman-south-sentinel.jpg" alt="south-sentinel beach with full of plastics" style="margin:auto" width="450" height="350">
                
                <p>A simple walk on any beach, anywhere, and the plastic waste spectacle is present. All over the world the
                statistics are ever growing, staggeringly. Tons of plastic debris (which by definition are waste that
                can vary in size from large containers,
                fishing nets to microscopic plastic pellets or even particles) is discarded every year, everywhere,
                polluting lands, rivers, coasts, beaches, and oceans.</p>

                <p>Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles
                (e.g.: plastic bottles and much more) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects wildlife,
                wildlife habitat, and humans. Plastics that
                act as pollutants are categorized into micro-, meso-, or macro debris, based on size. Plastics are
                inexpensive and durable, and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. However, the
                chemical structure of most plastics
                renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to
                degrade. Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the
                environment.</p>
             </div>           
             <div class="second">

                <p>As of 2018, about 380 million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year. From the 1950s up to 2018,
                an estimated 6.3 billion tons of plastic has been produced worldwide, of which an estimated 9% has been
                recycled and another 12% has
                been incinerated. This large amount of plastic waste enters the environment, with studies suggesting
                that the bodies of 90% of seabirds contain plastic debris. In some areas there have been significant
                efforts to reduce the prominence
                of free range plastic pollution, through reducing plastic consumption, litter cleanup, and promoting
                plastic recycling.</p>
                <p>Some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight.</p>
        
                <h3 class="text-center">Types of plastic debris</h3>
             
                <p>There are three major forms of plastic that contribute to plastic pollution: microplastics as well as mega-
                and macro-plastics. Mega- and micro plastics have accumulated in highest densities in the Northern
                Hemisphere, concentrated around urban
                centers and water fronts. Plastic can be found off the coast of some islands because of currents carrying
                the debris. Both mega- and macro-plastics are found in packaging, footwear, and other domestic items that
                have been washed off of ships or discarded in landfills. Fishing-related items are more likely to be found
                around remote islands. These
                may also be referred to as micro-, meso-, and macro debris.</p>
             </div>       
             <div class="third">
                <p>Plastic debris is categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary plastics are in their original form
                when collected. Examples of these would be bottle caps, cigarette butts, and microbeads. Secondary plastics,
                on the other hand, account for
                smaller plastics that have resulted from the degradation of primary plastics.</p>
                <img data-aos="flip-right" src="images/dead-body-of-a-bird-full-of-plastic.jpg" alt="Dead body of a bird full of plastic" width="450"
                height="350" />
                <h3 class="text-center">Effects on the environment</h3>
                <p>The distribution of plastic debris is highly variable as a result of certain factors such as wind and ocean
                currents, coastline geography, urban areas, and trade routes. Human population in certain areas also plays a
                large role in this. Plastics
                are more likely to be found in enclosed regions such as the Caribbean. It serves as a means of distribution
                of organisms to remote coasts that are not their native environments. This could potentially increase the
                variability and dispersal
                of organisms in specific areas that are less biologically diverse. Plastics can also be used as vectors for
                chemical contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals.</p>
                <h3 class="text-center">Effects on animals</h3>
                <p>Plastic pollution has the potential to poison animals, which can then adversely affect human food supplies.
                Plastic pollution has been described as being highly detrimental to large marine mammals, described in the
                book Introduction to Marine
                Biology as posing the "single greatest threat" to them. Some marine species, such as sea turtles, have been
                found to contain large proportions of plastics in their stomach. When this occurs, the animal typically
                starves, because the plastic
                blocks the animal's digestive tract. Sometimes Marine mammals are entangled in plastic products such as
                nets, which can harm or kill them.</p>
